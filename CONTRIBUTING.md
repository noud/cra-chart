# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

## Testing

Please write tests for new code you create.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to cra-chartjs](https://github.com/noud/cra-chartjs/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Start reading the code and you'll get the hang of it. The code is optimized for readability:

  * ELint

Thanks,
